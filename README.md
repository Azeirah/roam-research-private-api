# Roam private API

This library is a helper to automate your Roam Research adventures.

## How does it work?

It logs into chrome and performs actions on front-end, just as you would manually. No need to install chrome, this library comes with one.

## Examples

- [Sync your Roam graph to Evernote](./examples/sync_evernote.js)
- [Send note to Roam using the Quick Capture feature](./examples/quick_capture.js)


This is very much work in progress!
